CircuitSlide is a simple slide puzzle game. It combines the learning of circuitry and electronics in general with the joy of solving a tough puzzle.<br>
<br>
As of the current version, only a single level has been released; with respect to it being a prototype.<br> But more levels and features are expected to be released in the near future.<br>
<br>
CircuitSlide is also my first "Big" project using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).<br>
CircuitSlide has been made to support both desktop and mobile devices. <br>

## Gameplay
CircuitSlide is easy enough to play.<br>
A user would first start by clicking start button, followed by them clicking on tiles (or pressing the respective move keys from their keyboard) to move the tiles.<br> Using CircuitSlides `gameSolvabilityCheck` algorithm guarrantees all users that each game is 100% solvable.<br>
Users can spice up the game by competing against the time they took to win, or perhaps the number of moves they required.<br>
In a (_not-so-distant_) future version, a proper scoreboard will be added
